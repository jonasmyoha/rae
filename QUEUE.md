- [ ] Compiled backend: `List(Task(T))` element access lowers to `RaeAny` instead of `RaeTask*` — can't hold task handles in a `List` (generic-container element monomorphization). Workaround: use individual `Task` locals. Found building examples/40_raytracer.
- [ ] Compiled backend: `List(Struct).get()` returns boxed `RaeAny` and isn't auto-unboxed to the struct (must use low-level `rae_ext_rae_buf_get`). Generalize typed-struct-list element get(). Workaround in raytracer: flat `List(Float)` struct-of-arrays.
- [x] Compiled backend: passing a call/binary/object rvalue directly to a `view`/`mod` param dangled — the temp was a GCC statement-expression local (`({ T t = ...; &t; })`) whose lifetime ended before the callee dereferenced it (UB; read stale stack). Fixed in c_call.c by materializing into a one-element array compound literal `((T[1]){ rvalue })`, which has enclosing-block lifetime. This was the root cause of the interactive raytracer's "camera ignores yaw/pitch / always looks at origin": `buildCamera(target: vadd(camPos, fwd))` read a garbage look-at point.

- [ ] Language: add real `const` declarations (compile-time, immutable). Today "constants" are zero-arg functions (e.g. `func PI()`/`func TAU()` in lib/math.rae) because Rae has no immutable value binding (`let` is reassignable). Proposed: `const NAME: Type = <const-expr>` at module (and local) scope; UPPER_SNAKE naming; const-expr folding (literals + ops on consts); reassignment is a compile error; folded/inlined in both backends (VM constant pool, C `static const`/literal). Then convert PI()/TAU() to `const PI`/`const TAU` and drop the call `()`.
- [x] Compiler: spawn can now thread POD (cascade-drop-free) structs by value (was on the remaining list) — enables a by-value Camera struct in worker threads.

- [x] Language: `let` (immutable) / `var` (mutable) / `const` (compile-time, folded) implemented; module-level const folds to literals; naming de-enforced in parser. See docs/naming-conventions.md.
- [ ] Lint: optional compiler/linter WARNINGS for naming-convention violations (Types/enums PascalCase; functions/vars/consts/enum-cases camelCase). Must be warnings, not errors; exempt/suppressible for extern (C-binding) names. Needs a general warning framework first.

- [x] Examples: raytracer step 5 (examples/44_raytracer_5_lights) — emissive "light" material (kind 3), rae_ui-style scene lit by glowing spheres + dim ambient sky, preview/final resolution toggle (P), live camera HUD. Suite 55/0.
- [ ] Examples: raytracer step 6 — GPU raytracer (deferred; needs a compute/GPU path).
- [x] Resolved: interactive raytracer camera "ignored yaw/pitch / always looked at origin" in the compiled backend. Root cause was the dangling rvalue->view arg codegen bug (see the c_call.c item above): `buildCamera(target: vadd(camPos, fwd))` read a garbage look-at point. Fixed at the compiler level; camera now tracks yaw/pitch. (Earlier hypotheses about stale builds / left-drag were wrong.)

- [x] Live (bytecode VM): `spawn` ran the worker on a real OS thread, but the VM value model (ref-counted ValueBuffer/Object, shared string pool) is not thread-safe — concurrent workers raced on shared buffers (e.g. 4 raytracer tile workers sharing `world`) and SIGSEGV'd. Now Live runs `spawn` synchronously (inline sub-VM, returns a completed Task); compiled keeps real threads. All raytracer steps 1-5 run in Live.

- [ ] Strategy: execution targets & deployment decided — see docs/execution-targets-and-deployment.md. No TypeScript target; WASM (via the C backend) is the primary app/game target; C backend stays for native/desktop/real-time/hardware; Live VM kept on probation.
- [ ] Prototype: WASM generation via the C backend (clang/wasi-libc or Emscripten). Compile the raytracer to .wasm, run from a tiny JS harness writing into a SharedArrayBuffer drawn to a <canvas>. Measure WASM-vs-native speed. (Highest value-per-effort; gates the rest.)
- [ ] Prototype: WASM threads (SharedArrayBuffer + workers) + SIMD128 for the tiled raytracer — confirm real parallelism in the sandbox.
- [ ] Prototype: iPhone PoC app with OTA updates — Capacitor-style WKWebView shell running the Rae→WASM app, WASM/JS bundle hosted remotely and updated over-the-air without App Store resubmission (native shell fixed, WASM layer updatable). Confirm the App-Store-legal split.
- [ ] Prototype (if needed): one Rae→C native plugin driven at control-rate (e.g. audio) to validate the partition-by-data-rate bridge; Rae generates both ends.
- [ ] Later: WebGPU path from the WASM app (GPU compute / GPU raytracer step 6).

- [ ] Strategy: cross-platform tech stack & dependency policy decided — see docs/tech-stack-and-dependencies.md. Preference ordering Rae > C > any-lang-behind-clean-C-API > Rust > C++ > Obj-C; own small/controllable, buy hard domains, all foreign code behind Rae-owned APIs. Relax strict no-C++/no-Rust. Intended stack: SDL3 (platform) + WebGPU-everywhere/WGSL (render) + miniaudio (audio) + Rae-owned layers.
- [ ] Deprecate raylib: build Rae Platform/Render/2D/Audio layers, migrate examples off raylib, then drop the dependency. May keep ONE raylib example only if it stays cheap to build; otherwise remove entirely.

## New-stack on-ramp: first 3 steps toward WASM + WebGPU + compute raytracer (browser-first)
- [x] Step W1 — WASM-generation spike + smoke gate. DONE. Made rae_runtime.c wasm-portable (signals/threads/flock/fork-exec guarded under __wasm__). New example examples/46_raytracer_wasm_web: the raylib-free raytracer core → C backend → wasm32-wasip1 via wasi-sdk; emits RGB to stdout via an fbPixel extern. compiler/tools/wasm_build.sh (Rae→C→.wasm) + compiler/tools/wasm_run.mjs (WASI shim) + compiler/tools/wasm_smoke.sh (the gate: builds + runs in Node WASI, asserts 388800 bytes + lit-scene avg). Browser harness web/index.html (minimal WASI shim → canvas putImageData; same shim validated headless). Verified: correct step-3 image rendered in WASM; tests + examples 56/0 unaffected by the runtime guards. Toolchain: wasi-sdk-33 at ~/.local/wasi-sdk (set WASI_SDK). Compiled wasm ≈ native speed (vs the VM's ~100×). NOTE: needs browser confirmation of web/index.html on your machine.
- [ ] Step W2 — Rae Render API seam + WebGPU canvas blit (browser WebGPU, no Dawn/wgpu dep). Introduce a minimal Rae Render API (device/texture/pipeline/pass/draw) with a WEB backend over browser-provided WebGPU (Emscripten/JS interop). Milestone: upload the CPU framebuffer as a WebGPU texture and draw a fullscreen quad with a WGSL blit shader, replacing W1's putImageData. Establishes the seam, the first WGSL shader, and the texture/quad pipeline the 2D renderer + compute display will reuse. Deliverable: raytracer framebuffer shown via WebGPU+WGSL in the browser; Render API v0 (web backend).
- [ ] Step W3 — Compute raytracer example (step 6): rayColor as a WGSL compute shader. Port rayColor/scene/camera into a WGSL compute shader writing a storage texture, dispatched via the Render API compute path, displayed via the W2 blit. New example examples/45_raytracer_6_gpu_compute. Proves the compute path + WGSL-everywhere shader strategy. Deliverable: GPU path tracer running in the browser; Render API gains a compute pass.
- [ ] (after W1-W3) Native WebGPU (Dawn or wgpu-native) + SDL3 platform layer + incremental raylib removal — deferred until the browser path validates end-to-end.
